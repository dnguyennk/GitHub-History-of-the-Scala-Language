# GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language

## Project Description

Open source projects contain: Development histories (who made changes, the changes, and code reviews). The dataset includes the project history of Scala retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.

In this project, I investigated the data, cleaned up, and visualized the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. I found out who had had the most influence on its development and who were the experts.
